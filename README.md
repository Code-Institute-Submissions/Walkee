## Aim
Walkee is an exciting new app that allows dog owners to easily meet other dog owners and arrange walks together.

Most dogs are brought singularly and don't often spend much time with other members of their species.
Whilst on walks they have the chance to meet other dogs but this isn't guaranteed and often only for a couple of minutes.
Loneliness in dogs leads to separation anxiety, flawed socialisation and ultimately poor mental health and behaviour.

Walkee aims to fix this issue by bringing dogs together for substantial amounts of time. You'll be able to improve their behavior, track physical health and hopefully make new friends too!

This website aims to easily educate interested dog owners, provide ample opportunity to download the app and follow the company on social media to improve brand awareness. 
It also acts as a login page for existing users who'd rather use the app in browser form.
## UX
The design of Walkee's website stems from analysing the customer and business goals.

As a business Walkee's aims were simple:
* Get more downloads of the app
* Educate propective users easily 
* Allow existing users to log on to the platform
* Get more brand interaction with users through social media

This meant their always has to be a download or social link within 2 clicks maximum. Easily sign-posted information for propective users. Some form of login functionality and lots of calls to get the app or follow Walkee's social in the copy.

Looking at apps which follow in the same vein of people meeting in the physical world through online apps like [Tinder](https://tinder.com/?lang=en-GB), [Grindr](https://www.grindr.com/), [Geocaching](https://www.geocaching.com/play/mobile), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/a/join-new?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc-brand&utm_campaign=Search-google-brand_184_18_UK-London_d_all_acq_cpc_uk-en_Exact&adgroup_name=Pure-Brand-Misspelling&utm_term=%C3%BCber&kw=%C3%BCber&campaign_id=71700000039840326&cid=71700000039840326&adgroup_id=58700004296343639&adg_id=58700004296343639&kw_id=p35756579852&kwid=p35756579852&ad_id=321226171594&ext_id=&ran=9628064932952514583&lint_id=9045872&lphy_id=1006621&pos=1t1&dev=c&net=g&match=e&placement=&target=&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkKnyBRDwARIsALtxe7hZC-vqJ0M3a5wrei6L_GeJV9cSwGheH48uurLf7ndEasMCsR5Y0loaAjffEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Pokemon GO](https://www.pokemongo.com/en-gb/) it was clear that less infomation on the home page is more. Instead much like other websites in a B2C model there was lots of emotive pictures and calls to action which heavily infulcend walkee's design.

Our customer aims were alot more utilitarian:
* Download the app
* Sign In/Sign up
* Learn more about the app

These helped influcnece the information achiecture of the app. There needed to be a clearly sign-posted information about how to acheieve these goals and easy infuituve naviagtion which provides positive feedback when you click on a link.

### Target Demographic
As Walkee's target demographic is the broad Dog owners the website had to feel friendly had inclusive to everyone.

This is acheived by:
* Using a gender neutral palette that evoke the feel of autumn dog walk
* Having a very simple, almost linear website that even less tech savvy users can control
* Avoiding harsh lines where ever possible to give a friendly feel to the website
* Picking a more fun font to represent the brand, dog walks are supposed to be enjoyed.
